# AI-Enabled Recommendation Engine for an E-Commerce Platform

## 📌 Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This repository contains the first step in building an AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform.

Data cleaning is a critical foundation for developing accurate recommendation models. Raw datasets often contain missing, inconsistent, or invalid values that must be handled before analysis or model training.

---

## 🎯 Objective of This Phase

To prepare a clean, structured, and reliable dataset that can be used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Recommendation Model Development

---

## 🛠 Data Cleaning Tasks Performed

- Replaced invalid or inconsistent values with `NaN`
- Converted ID columns to numeric format
- Removed rows containing missing or null values
- Cleaned `ProdID` column by dropping invalid entries
- Ensured overall data consistency and integrity

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📂 File Included

- `preprocess_data.py` – Contains all preprocessing and data cleaning functions

---

## 📌 Importance

Accurate data preprocessing improves:
- Model performance
- Prediction reliability
- System efficiency

This step forms the backbone of the upcoming AI-based recommendation system.
